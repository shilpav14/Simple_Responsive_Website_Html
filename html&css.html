			<p>* HTML and CSS are the core web scripting languages, the primary use of which is to create web pages and web application. The crucial difference between the two is that HTML is used for the creation of the webpages and CSS is used to control the styling and layout of web pages. <br></p>

			<p>* In HTML, firstly you write words then add elements or tags to it, which thereafter appear on your page. Through this way, the browser gets to know the heading of the page, beginning and ending of the paragraph, and so on.<br> </p>

			<p>* In CSS, rules are used by utilising CSS properties. CSS properties are generally classified into two broad categories. First is the presentation which specifies the colour of the text, font type, font size, background colours, background images, etc. Second is layout defines the position of the different elements on the screen.<br> </p>
